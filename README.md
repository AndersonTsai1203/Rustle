# ðŸŒ€ Rustle
Play on "Rust" and "hustle" or "sketch". Short, snappy, memorable.

## ðŸ“˜ Background & Motivation
**Rustle** is a lightweight, expressive drawing engine powered by an **embedded Logo-inspired DSL** (domain-specific language). Rooted in the legacy of educational programming and visual computing, Rustle reinterprets the iconic "turtle graphics" concept through a modern systems lens using **Rust**.

Rustle enables users to write structured Logo programs that control a virtual turtleâ€”moving, rotating, and drawing with fine-grained control. These programs are parsed and executed into **SVG** or **PNG** outputs, bridging the gap between textual programming and visual feedback.

This project is an opportunity to build a **custom interpreter**, an **SVG rendering engine**, and a **domain-specific execution model** â€” all while applying clean Rust architecture and modular design principles.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Rustle
Rustle merges **retro computing nostalgia** with modern systems design best practices. It offers a clean, deterministic environment to learn about **interpreters**, **state machines**, **graphics pipelines**, and **DSL design** â€” with real visual output to demonstrate what your code is doing.

This project also highlights your ability to:
- Design modular, testable Rust software
- Work with parsing, graphics, and system abstractions
- Deliver both creative and technical outcomes

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Build an interpreter that parses and executes a custom Logo dialect.
- Design an extensible, modular Rust application with well-separated components.
- Convert turtle motion commands into vector graphics.
- Offer a clean developer interface for generating programmatic art.

| ```turtle``` |	Represents position, heading, pen state, pen color, etc. |
| ```render``` |	Converts turtle path into SVG or PNG |
| ```repl``` |	Provides optional interactive mode |
| ```examples/``` |	Shows usage patterns and sample art |
| ```assets/``` |	Stores .logo scripts and their visual outputs |

## ðŸ§  Core Features
#### Part 1: Turtle Control Command
- [ ] ```PENUP```: Set the turtle to "up" mode where it doesn't draw.
- [ ] ```PENDOWN```: Set the turtle to "down" mode where it draws while moving.
- [ ] ```FORWARD```: Move the turtle forward by a specified number of pixels.
- [ ] ```BACK```: Move the turtle backward by a specified number of pixels.
- [ ] ```LEFT```: Turn the turtle left by a specified number of degrees.
- [ ] ```RIGHT```: Turn the turtle right by a specified number of degrees.
- [ ] ```SETPENCOLOR```: Set the pen color to one of the 16 predefined colors.
- [ ] ```TURN```: Turn the turtle by a specified number of degrees (relative rotation).
- [ ] ```SETHEADING```: Set the turtleâ€™s heading to a specified direction (absolute angle).
- [ ] ```SETX```: Set the turtle's X position to a specific coordinate.
- [ ] ```SETY```: Set the turtle's Y position to a specific coordinate.
- [ ] Handle Initial Turtle Position: Ensure the turtle starts at the center of the image (adjust for odd/even dimensions).

#### Part 2: Variables and Queries

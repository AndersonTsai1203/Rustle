# Rustle
A Logo interpreter in Rust that draws and dazzles
Play on "Rust" and "hustle" or "sketch". Short, snappy, memorable.

## Background & Motivation
This project centers around building a **Logo interpreter**, a historically significant educational programming language known for its **"turtle graphics"** — a visual paradigm where commands move a virtual turtle to draw lines and shapes. Logo’s simplicity made it the first programming experience for many early developers.
 
The primary motivation of this assignment is to explore interpreter design and modular Rust architecture, emphasizing:
- Practical software engineering principles: clean code, maintainability, and reusable components.
- Creative expression through graphics: generating SVG or PNG output from parsed Logo commands.
- Historical context with modern tooling: blending classic computer science concepts with modern systems programming in Rust.

Rather than focusing on complex language semantics or algorithmic challenges, the core objective is **design excellence** — structuring a scalable, idiomatic Rust application that turns simple textual commands into meaningful, visual output.
